Learning github..

This is easy to learn and I like the process a lot. It's for Winners!!!

This is another correction I changed just now!

It seems as if I have to make the pull request once and keep updating. That may be incorrect.
(Turns out that above statement is incorrect. I have to go through the process. Or I just update and commit the changes without having to do a pull request.)
